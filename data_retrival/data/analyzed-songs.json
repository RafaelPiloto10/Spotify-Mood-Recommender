you're making me feel\n\nGirl would you be my, would you be my...\nSweet little something\nBaby we'll get by we'll get by\nSweet little something\nGive me just one night\nSo let me ask you\nGirl would

bear with me\nAre you aware that we're making hist'ry?\nThis is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation\nThe liberty behind deliberation\n(Non-stop!)\nI intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt\nWith my assistant counsel\n\nCo-counsel\nHamilton, sit down\nOur client Levi Weeks is innocent\nCall your first witness\nThat's all you had to say!\n\nOkay!\nOne more thing\u2013\n\nWhy do you assume you're the smartest in the room?\nWhy do you assume you're the smartest in the room?\nWhy do you assume you're the smartest in the room?\nSoon that attitude may be your doom!\n\nWhy do you

In the meantime\u2014\n\n(Non-stop!)\nCorruption's such an old song that we can sing\nAlong in harmony and nowhere is it stronger\nThan in Albany\nThis colony's economy's increasingly stalling and\nHonestly that's why he's just public service seems\nTo be calling me\n(Non-stop!)\nI practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it\nI've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it\nNow for a strong central democracy\nIf not, then I'll be Socrates\nThrowing verbal rocks at these mediocrities\n\nHamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:\n\nI was chosen for the Constitutional Convention\n\nThere as a New York junior delegate:\n\nNow what I'm going to say may sound indelicate\n\nGoes and proposes his own form of government!\n(What?)\nHis own plan for a new form of government!\n(What?)\nTalks for six hours! The convention is listless!\n\nBright young man\n\nYo, who the eff is this?\n\nWhy do you always say what you believe?\nWhy do you always, why do you always\nSay what you believe? Say what you believe?\nEv'ry proclamation guarantees\nFree ammunition for your enemies!\n(Awww!)\nWhy do you write like it's going out of style?\nGoing out of style (Hey!)\nWrite day and night like it's going out of style?\nGoing out of style (Hey!)\nEv'ry day you fight like it's going out of style\nDo what you do\n\nAlexander?\n\nAaron Burr, sir\n\nIt's the middle of the night\n\nCan we confer,

or I'm reeling in pain\nI need to shake this fucking habit, so I try, but I can't\nAnd I look down on other addicts when we're one and the same\nRemember back, I'm pushin' twenty, those were simpler times\nThat's when we met, and ever since you're never far from my mind\nI broke my ankle playin' ball, and so it's you I'm prescribed\nAnd even through all of the pain, you make me feel I could fly\nA couple weeks, and now you're gone and now I'm feelin' the stress\nI always wanted to feel something, maybe nothing is best\nMy friends and family start to question if I'm feelin' depressed\nBut I don't really give a damn, just put me back on the meds\nI've been lost in my head\nMy homie Jack said he dealt with the same shit\nHe said he started drinkin' to deal with the pain quick\nAll you need is a fifth and it's cool to remain lit\nSo he handed me a bottle, said, \"Take about eight sips\"\nI'm faded, but I wanna feel straight numb\nSo I drink the rest of the bottle, liquor burnin' my gums\nWoke up the next day at around a quarter to one\nMy peers would say that \"Man I had fun, right?\"\n\nI've been lyin', I've been sayin' I'm fine\nBut I've been feeling low and I don't know

out with someone knew, changed your crew\nDon't know why we ever said\nWe should still be friends\n\nWas it enough?\nI did all the things that you preferred?\nLike a night spent on the rox, now who we

change\nThese battle\n\nNever let a wound ruin me\nBut I feel like ruin's wooing me\nArrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shooting spree\nFeeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me\n\nBut when you're trying to beat the odds up\nBeen trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know\nAnd let her go but the fear of the unknown\nHolding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone\nWith no Tom Hanks to bring you home\nA lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem\nTrying to write yourself a rifle\nMaybe sharpen up a song\nTo fight the tanks and drones of you being alone\n\nI wish I never looked, I wish I never touched\nI wish that I could stop loving you so much\n'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together\nWhen all of the signs say that I should forget her\n\nI wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had\nI wish that the good outweighed the bad\n'Cause it'll never be over (It never be over)\n", "song-features":

shit\nAnd it got me hella excited 'cause I always wanted to do like\nA Last Call, I remember the first time I heard Kanye's\nI thought that shit was so tight dawg\nI was like, man I'm tryna tell my story, you know what I'm sayin'\nAnd then uh, I remember Cole did it, when did he do it?\nHe was on Friday Night Lights?\nNah nah, he did it on The Warm Up yo\nWhen he did the Last Call on the warmup I was like:\nDamn I'm tryna do mine\nSo since this joint got that vibe\nI'ma do my Last Call right now for y'all\nAnd my voice is messed up too, this is the last track of Young Sinatra\n\nYeah, yeah\nBack in the day I wasn't shit, homie\nPenny pinching I couldn't even pay the rent, homie\nThinkin' 'bout it I'm wondering where the years went, homie\nJust a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me\nI was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin' homie\nI was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin' homie\nLetting them slip away, my dreams wasn't waitin' on me\nThis for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen\nI'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did\nAnd yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kid\nBut that shit came from sacrifice\nNot on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (listen)\nYeah\n\nSomeway somehow, I understood finally\nIf you want to come and get it you know where to find me\nCause I don't got no time for anyone who be tryin' me\nKnow if they don't understand I'ma leave 'em behind me\nI'll be asleep\nI ain't got no time, no no\nI said I'll be asleep\nI said I don't got no time, no, no, no\n\nYeah, yeah\nI treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA\nAnd this that southern playa-listic shit like we was in the eight\nBack in the day, I was young, broke and infamous\nA Young Sinatra, I was undeniable\nWho welcomed you to forever while Under Pressure\nAnd told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino\nAnd Everybody in the Ultra 85\nGoddamn it feel good to be alive\nAnd all these bitches that I passed up\nCouldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up\nMember creeping with the gat, masked up\n\nGoddamn it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man\nWhat it was like growing up.\nDamn man, just,\nMotherfuckers running in and out of the crib,\nDoing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff.\nMeanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together,\nI was tryna make sense-sense of all this shit around me,\nI didn't know how to take it,\nHow to perceive it, you know what I mean.\nAnd then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting\nGood grades and shit, but I'm seeing like,\nDomestic violence in my house, and just, so much going on.\nAnd I'm sure everybody was probably like, damn, yo\n\nWhy little Bobby didn't come to school today?\"\nOn the real, I was doin' anything to run away\nAnd that's the same reason kids join gangs every day\nCause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected\nMeanwhile, white america quick to call him a thug\nBut all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love\nTell him that he love him, that he need him\nPromise he won't ever leave him\nNever smoke crack, never lie, and he'll never beat him\nI feel like all my life I been needing a break\nLooking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake\nAnd I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great\nOh my God please, can I have a conversation with 'em?\nMember of my family without they hand out asking for five G's\nTo pay they bills or they lawyer fees (huh)\nI learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime\nI'll give you something worth more, that's my time\nI ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge\nUnless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college\nAnd hit me on the phone, hit me up\nLike \"\nUncle Bob, where you at?\nYeah I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that\nI'm glad we family\" (uh)\nWe a half breed family, yeah, yeah, uh\n\nMan see I remember when I was like fifteen years old and my

to you while I've stayed\nFaithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid\nLook at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess\nAlways in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet\nNot even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect\nI've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness\nAnd I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left\nBut you keep treating me like a staircase it's time to fucking step\nAnd I wont be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath\nYou know what you've done no need to go in depth\n", "song-features": {"artists":

(Fuck my side chick!)\n\nYou won't ever see Em icy\n", "song-features": {"artists": "[{\"external_urls\":{\"spotify\":\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\"},\"href\":\"https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\",\"id\":\"7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\",\"name\":\"Eminem\",\"type\":\"artist\",\"uri\":\"spotify:artist:7dGJo4pcD2V6oG8kP0tJRR\"}]", "name": "The Ringer", "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2jt2WxXMCD4zjACthkJQVE", "id": "2jt2WxXMCD4zjACthkJQVE", "features": {"danceability": 0.939, "energy": 0.551, "key": 1, "loudness": -9.126, "mode": 1, "speechiness": 0.291, "acousticness": 0.0311, "instrumentalness": 0, "liveness": 0.192, "valence": 0.42, "tempo": 118.552, "type": "audio_features", "id": "2jt2WxXMCD4zjACthkJQVE", "uri": "spotify:track:2jt2WxXMCD4zjACthkJQVE", "track_href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2jt2WxXMCD4zjACthkJQVE", "analysis_url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/2jt2WxXMCD4zjACthkJQVE", "duration_ms": 337941, "time_signature": 4}}, "song-polarity": -0.4190625}, {"song-title": "Burn", "song-artists": "Andra Day", "song-lyrics": "I saved every letter you wrote me\nFrom the moment I read them\nI knew you were mine, said you were mine\nI thought you were mine\n\nDo you know what Angelica said\nWhen we saw your first letter arrive?\nShe said, \"Be careful with that one, love\nHe will do what it takes to survive.\"\n\nYou and your words flooded my senses\nYour sentences left me defenseless\nYou built me palaces out of paragraphs\nYou built cathedrals\n\nI'm re-reading the letters you wrote me\nI'm searching and scanning for answers\nIn every line, for some kind of sign\nAnd when you were mine\nThe world seemed to\n\n", "song-features": {"artists": "[{\"external_urls\":{\"spotify\":\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1c4rxrxy8eDLvMVL1DTiBe\"},\"href\":\"https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/1c4rxrxy8eDLvMVL1DTiBe\",\"id\":\"1c4rxrxy8eDLvMVL1DTiBe\",\"name\":\"Andra Day\",\"type\":\"artist\",\"uri\":\"spotify:artist:1c4rxrxy8eDLvMVL1DTiBe\"}]", "name": "Burn", "url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2ZVWg6VCq8FQdeD5yuWD9r", "id": "2ZVWg6VCq8FQdeD5yuWD9r", "features": {"danceability": 0.319, "energy": 0.322, "key": 1, "loudness": -9.165, "mode": 1, "speechiness": 0.0726, "acousticness": 0.644, "instrumentalness": 1.33e-06, "liveness": 0.131, "valence": 0.102, "tempo": 197.818, "type": "audio_features", "id": "2ZVWg6VCq8FQdeD5yuWD9r", "uri": "spotify:track:2ZVWg6VCq8FQdeD5yuWD9r", "track_href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2ZVWg6VCq8FQdeD5yuWD9r", "analysis_url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/2ZVWg6VCq8FQdeD5yuWD9r", "duration_ms": 219440, "time_signature": 3}}, "song-polarity": 0.2752666666666666}, {"song-title": "One Day (feat.

close when you show it\nBefore you know it I'm lost at sea\nAnd now that I write and think about it\nAnd the story unfolds\nYou should take my life, you should take my soul\n\nYou are surrounding all my surroundings\nSounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain\nYou are surrounding all my surroundings\nTwisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes\n\nAnd I'll be holding on to you\nAnd I'll be holding on to you\n\nRemember the moment you know exactly where you're going\n'Cause the next moment, before you know it\nTime is slowing and it's frozen still\nAnd the window sill looks really nice, right?\nYou think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?\nFight it, take the pain, ignite it\nTie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine and tie

handys with the sanny, Xannys in the Caddy armrest\nI'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs\nFrom a daddy longleg\nAnd ham trending, got the panoramic camera\nXanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat\nI'm smellin' like a damn mechanic\nWith a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent\n", "song-features": {"artists":

can't fuck with that\nYou're the only girl I need I gotta have you back\nEven though you turn my lungs black\nTell me where you've been jack\nUh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary\nI used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing\nSkipping school with all my homies on some truancy\nBut when I ended things with her it was just you and me\nDoing me good, that's what I thought at first\nMe and you together, swear to God that's all that worked\nAway from you though man it's just so hard to work\n", "song-features": {"artists":

texto la lleva el chofer\nMama la despide en la puerta agitando los brazos\nLa nena tiene 9 a\u00f1os como iba a saber\nQue hace mas de cuatro meses que le siguen los pasos\nY el auto que espera a dos cuadras enciende el motor\n\nUn tiro en la sien al chofer la nena va a la deriva\nUn auto detiene la inercia; ellos la tienen rodeada\nSu frente dio contra el cristal y le ha abierto una herida\nLos vecinos se encierran con llave nadie a visto nada\nY la mano que mato a su chofer ahora le opaca los gritos\nLa nena es un uno con ceros a partir de hoy\n", "song-features": {"artists":

quiere prender and dance to dembow\nShe might give you a wine but just as friends though\nAnd you a lucky guy if you touch end zone\n", "song-features": {"artists":

you're done with it\nIf I was the last man here on earth\nWhat's it gonna take to make this work?\n\nDrove to LA trying to find myself\nBe some else, said I wouldn't so I called you bluff\nNow I'm
